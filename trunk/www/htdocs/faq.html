    <h4>
       1. What is Revenge?
    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         Revenge is research into reverse engineering.
      </p>

    <h4>
       2. Is there any reverse engineering software here?
    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         The first planned piece of software is going to be called "revenge". It will emulate i386 protected mode for user space applications. When an application is loaded into the emulator, the emulator will analyse the program as it runs and output details of what the program is doing. Which instructions are executed. Which parts of the program are data, and which are instructions. By watching the program as it runs, one will be able to build up a real life idea of the program's structure and what each function does. It will output an intermediate file containing a representation of what instructions were executed, and allow for later analysis in order to represent it in a more human readable form. It will provide for human interaction so that if a human recognises what a particular function does, it can give it a name, and also name variables. It will allow for the application to be rerun as a whole or just parts of it, so that the human can understand more details about what a particular function does. As time goes by, more and more of the previous human activity can then be automated. It will be an interesting research project discovering exactly how much of the reverse engineering process can be automated. The reason for the emulation, is so that the program can use information gathered while actually running the program to be able to make more educated guesses as to what certain program sections do.
