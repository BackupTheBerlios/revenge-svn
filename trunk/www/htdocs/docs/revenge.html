<H1>Revenge Emulator Documentation</H1>
<H1>1. Aims.</H1>
<H4>1) The first planned piece of software is going to be called
&quot;revenge&quot;.</H4>
<H4>2) It will emulate i386 32-bit protected mode for user space
applications.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Later Pentium4/AMD etc. will be added.</DD><DD>
	We might even add PPC/Sparc/MIPS support.We will only support 32bit
	Protected mode in user space.</DD><DD>
	We will not support Real or Old mode but someone might want to add
	support for that and we will let them.</DD><DD>
	If an application uses a call gate (ring3 -&gt; other ring call), we
	will prevent it from accessing ring0, and instead fully emulate what
	the call would have achieved.</DD><DD>
	Later we might support some ring0 emulations in order to reverse
	engineer device drivers.</DD></DL>
<H4>
3) Different processor threads will be emulated as if running on
their own CPU with options to share memory or not.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>The first version will not support threads.</DD></DL>
<H4>
4) Initially it will support a.out executable format, with elf added
later, followed by other formats that are supported in other
environments apart from <SPAN LANG="en-GB">Linux</SPAN></H4>
<H4>5) The first application to be worked on will be a simple &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo; binary.</H4>
<H4>6) As each assembler instruction is executed, it will be logged.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>If an instruction accessed memory, the memory location and value
	used will be logged.</DD></DL>
<H4>
7) When a memory location is accessed, it will be logged.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>The details logged will be details regarding whether it was
	accessed as a instruction or data, how many times it has been
	accessed, and which instructions accessed it.</DD></DL>
<H4>
8) All calls, jump, ret's will be executed as if they are a
combination of PUSH/POP and JUMP.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Later, after the program flow has been logged, groups of
	instructions can then be grouped into functions. One reason for this
	is that a &ldquo;ret&rdquo; instruction can be turned into a &ldquo;jump&rdquo;
	just by preceding it with some PUSH instructions.</DD></DL>
<H4>
9) A C program will be produced, that if compiled, should function in
exactly the same way as the original binary.</H4>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"> Although it will compile as C, it will
probably be very difficult to understand, as it will have no symbols,
and the functional structure might be wrong.</P>
<H4>10) The next task will be using the logs together with the
generated C program and find ways to automate the manipulation of it
so that it is easier to read and understand.</H4>
<H4>11) Recovery of the parameter types passed to a function.</H4>
<H4>12) Recovery of variable types.</H4>
<H4>13) Recovery of returned types.</H4>
<H4>14) Determine which variables are local, global, or
runtime(malloc'ed) created.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>For example. If a CPU register is modified inside a function.
	After returning from the function, if that register is read, that
	register was a global or return value. If that register is just
	overwritten, that register was a local variable inside that
	function.</DD></DL>
<H4>
15) Determine which variables need to be initialised before calling a
function.</H4>
<H4>16) Determine what range of values a variable can take.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Useful for analysing sizes of lookup tables.</DD></DL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">
<BR>
</P>
<H4>17) Determine which variables are modified or created by a
function.</H4>
<H4>18) Using the logged counts of the amount of times a particular
function is called.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>Efforts will be made to understand most used functions first.</DD></DL>
<H4>
19) Allow human interaction to add comments, function and variable
names.</H4>
<H4>20) The GUI controlling front end will be a separate application
from the actual emulator, allowing for remote emulator control and
interactivity.</H4>
<H4>21) Every application is likely to depend on external libs. The
emulator will be able to run on the entire program including any
external libs, but logging and analysis can be restricted to a
particular lib the program uses or even just a particular function
inside a lib.</H4>
<H4>22) Some shim code might be needed to buffer access the
application has to outside libs.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>For example, if the application being examined uses a lib that
	does not need to be reverse engineered, we might only need to log
	parameters passed and results returned from the lib as we will
	already know exactly what each function does.</DD></DL>
<H4>
23) Be able to save the entire emulated application state, so that
one can come back later and continue. As one will know which memory
locations have been used, and which have not, one can save on the
amount of information needed to be saved in order to save the state.</H4>
<H2>2. Expected problems to overcome.</H2>
<H4>1) The i386 instruction set is huge.</H4>
<DL>
	<DD>We will start by only supporting the i386 instructions needed
	for &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo;.</DD></DL>
<H4>
2) We have no real idea if emulation will actually help us any more
than the current reverse engineering methods out there until we try
it!</H4>
