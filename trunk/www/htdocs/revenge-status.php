<H2>Revenge Status

<P> The revenge software application developement has already started. We have only built the program loader part so far. We can do the equivalent to what objdump does, except that we don't do disassembly yet.

<P> The next step is writing the x86 to RTL instruction decoder. This will take x86 instruction hex code and convert it directly into RTL instructions.
